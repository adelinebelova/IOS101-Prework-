## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**List of my favorite applications and why:** 
- [ ] Etsy 
- Aesthetically pleasing color and font palette throughout the app
- "Updates" section to notify me on changes to my favorite items 
- Intuitive Explore/Recommendation pages that match my interests 

- [ ] Co - Star 
- Beautiful imagery and monochromatic color palette that emphasize the messages within the app 
- Very simple black and white design that makes it feel clean and not overwhelming
- Having a friend's list where I can view their app information quickly at a glance without having to access their profiles directly 

- [ ] Spotify 
- Very organized sections that are easy to navigate, including self-made playlists and Spotify recommended playlists 
- Clearly emphasizes new releases from artists I regularly listen to on the home page 
- Simple fonts and color palette allow album covers to shine without feeling over-cluttered 

- [ ] Notion 
- Initial design is very simple and allows for a massive range of customizations depending on user preference 
- Neatly scales pages created on a computer to smaller phone/tablet screens 
- Easy to navigate sections 

**App idea:**

I am someone who is very interested in cooking and being in the kitchen. Although apps like Notion help me to organize recipe ideas and grocery lists, I want an app that will help me to automate this process. This app's main goal is to help users create lists of their existing pantry/fridge items and show them what recipes they are able to make with the ingredients they currently have. Users would enter their favorite recipes along with their initial pantry/fridge stock. They are able to create grocery lists of things to buy and add it to their stock once purchased. If a recipe is marked as cooked, the app will automatically deduct the ingredients from their stock. The UX/UI would be inspired by websites like *graza.co*, with their pleasing color palette and quirky font/text-box choices. 


## Notes

As someone who is used to coding primarily in VSCode, Xcode was definitely a bit of a learning curve. It took me some time to get used to navigating through the buttons and knowing where things went. Though I had some bugs pop up that crashed my app (most likely due to an issue with the button), I was able to resolve those problems and produce the desired product.
